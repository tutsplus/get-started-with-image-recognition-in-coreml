# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [Get Started with Image Recognition in Core ML][published url]
## Instructor: [Vardhan Agrawal][instructor url]

With technological advances, we're at the point where our devices can use their built-in cameras to accurately identify and label images using a pre-trained data set. You can also train your own models, but in this tutorial, we'll be using an open-source model to create an image classification app.

I'll show you how to create an app that can identify images. We'll start with an empty Xcode project, and implement machine-learning-powered image recognition one step at a time.
